        "- Deployment\n",
        "\n",
        "## Planning\n",
        "\n",
        "Choosing what to work on and what is the measurement of success is the most important part of the project.\n",
        "\n",
        "Get help here! Ask domain experts, business people, meditate on it. Do spend some time to think about it. But don't linger for too long. Analysis paralysis is a very common phenomenon in the real world!\n",
        "\n",
        "## Prototyping a baseline model\n",
        "\n",
        "Jupyter notebooks are a great prototyping/experimentation tool. You can use a notebook(s) to get some quick ideas about the feasibility and performance of a model.\n",
        "\n",
        "After you get some results, you'll proceed to create a full-blown project containing the baseline model. This will be a lot of work, but some rewards you might expect are bug fixes, new ideas, and developing something that (hopefully) has a real-world impact.\n",
        "\n",
        "Next, we'll go over an example task of automating the decision of whether a bank customer has good or bad credit risk.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Getting your data\n",
        "\n",
        "If you haven't solved any real-world ML problems yet, you might believe that most datasets get stored as CSV files. While this format is great when learning, you'll often need to understand SQL, pickle, HDF5, Parquet, and many more. \n",
        "\n",
        "#### Labeling\n",
        "\n",
        "Sometimes your data will have labels, but it might not be exactly the data you need. Other times, you'll miss labels altogether. What can you do?\n",
        "\n",
        "Creating a labeling infrastructure will be time well spent, for sure. Increasing the data size and reducing the noise in your data (having less wrong data) will dramatically increase the predictive power of your model(s).\n",
        "\n",
        "You will always want more and cleaner data. So keep getting it, slowly but surely. At some point, you'll notice you start getting diminishing returns. Depending on the problem you're solving, it might be a good idea to focus on other issues in the project."
